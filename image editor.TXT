"I created a web-based image editor using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users apply different filters
 like brightness, saturation, inversion, and grayscale, and also make transformations like rotating and
  flipping images. Users can upload their images, see real-time previews of the changes, and save the edited 
  images."
