Q. have u faced conflict in group project (Medi-connect)
Yes, I faced a conflict during the development of a healthcare website called Medi-Connect in college. There was a disagreement among team members about the design and functionality. Some members preferred a more minimalist interface, focusing on essential features, while others wanted to include additional functionalities to enhance user engagement.

To address this, I proposed that we hold a team meeting to discuss our ideas openly. We weighed the pros and cons of both approaches and decided to prioritize a user-friendly design while still incorporating key features that added value. This compromise allowed us to create a well-rounded website that met both user needs and our project goals. The experience strengthened our teamwork and communication, leading to a successful final product.

Q. how did you have divided the work among team
When we started the Medi-Connect project, we held an initial meeting to discuss everyone's strengths and interests, then we divided the work among several key teams like UI/UX team focused on creating an attractive and engaging user experience to ensure the design was user-friendly.The front-end development team was responsible for coding the user interface and implementing design elements. A separate content creation team handled the research and writing of health-related articles for the website.
