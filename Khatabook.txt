"Khatabook" is an account-keeping application that I developed using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and
 EJS for server-side rendering making it possible to generate dynamic web pages on the server 
 before sending them to the client. The application includes secure user authentication features such as 
 login and signup, using JWT for session management and bcrypt for password encryption to maintain data security.

The app allows users to create, view, manage, and filter 'Hisaab' entries. Each entry can be
 encrypted for added privacy, with an option to set a passcode. Users can also create shareable 
 files with editable permissions to allow for collaboration and easy access.

I implemented Axios POST requests to create shareable files with encrypted permissions,
 allowing other users to access the file in real-time using a secure passcode provided by the owner.



This project helped me improve my backend development skills and allowed me to explore real-world applications
 for organizing and managing records efficiently.
